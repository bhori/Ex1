#Ex1 It is a Java project that includes a monom, a polynomial, and complex functions.
This project allows to construct monom from string or coefficient and power, polynomial from string or empty , and a complex function consisting of polynomials and complex functions. This project allows arithmetic operations between polynomials and monomers, allows to compare monom, polynomials and complex functions, allows to calculate f (x), in each of the functions.
This project allows you to create a collection of functions either by adding functions or by reading from a text file, and also allows you to create a text file that contains the functions in the collection.
Another thing is it also lets you display the functions on a screen with the x axis and the y axis. The data: Length and width of the screen, axis areas and resolution, can be entered directly or by reading from a json file.
